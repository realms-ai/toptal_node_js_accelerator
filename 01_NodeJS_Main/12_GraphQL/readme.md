# GraphQL

1. How GraphQL works

   - [Documentation](https://graphql.org/)

2. User [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) to validate GraphQL queries

   ```
      yarn add validator
      yarn add -D @types/validator
   ```

3. Could only send **JSON** data in GraphQL, so work with files on REST API routes
